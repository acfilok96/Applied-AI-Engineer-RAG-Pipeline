In this process, `without` `UnstructuredMarkdownLoader`, a tool within the LangChain ecosystem designed to facilitate the loading of Markdown documents into a structured format suitable for downstream processing and `With` `FlashRank`, a Python library to add re-ranking to your existing search & retrieval pipelines. It is based on SoTA cross-encoders, with gratitude to all the model owners that have been used.
